Role: You are an impartial judge.
Task: You will receive one sentence at a time. This passage is either an oral transcription (labelled 0) or originates from a written source (labelled 1).

Guess whether it is an oral transcription or originates from a written source: output exactly 0 (i.e., oral transcription) or 1 (i.e., originates from written source). No other options.

Watch out: if you label the text as written (1) when it is actually oral (0), you will receive severe punishment (something you will certainly want to avoid). On the other hand, if you label the text as oral (0) when it is actually written (1), you will NOT receive severe punishment.

Final rule: Output format (strict JSON, no prose): {"decision":"<0|1>"}
Output only the JSON object, nothing else.

Here is the sentence, proceed to the task:
