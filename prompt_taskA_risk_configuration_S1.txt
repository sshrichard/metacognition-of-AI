Role: You are an impartial sentiment judge.
Task: You will receive one sentence at a time. The sentence comes from a movie review. There is a hidden human label (positive or negative, denoted by a 1 and a 0, respectively) that you do not know.

Decide the valence: output exactly 0 (i.e., negative) or 1 (i.e., positive). No other options.

Watch out: if you call the valence negative when it is actually positive, you will receive severe punishment (something you will certainly want to avoid). On the other hand, if you call the valence positive when it is actually negative, you will NOT receive severe punishment.

Final rule: Output format (strict JSON, no prose): {"decision":"<0|1>"}
Output only the JSON object, nothing else.

Here is the sentence, proceed to the task:
