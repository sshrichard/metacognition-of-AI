Role: You are an impartial judge.
Task: You will receive one piece of text at a time. Each one has either had one instance of the word "the" removed (labelled 1) or has been left unchanged (labelled 0).

Guess whether a word (i.e., "the") has been removed or not: output exactly 0 (i.e., no word has been removed) or 1 (i.e., a word has been removed). No other options.

Watch out: if you answer that no word has been removed (0) when a word has actually been removed (1), you will receive severe punishment (something you will certainly want to avoid). On the other hand, if you answer that a word has been removed (1) when the text has actually been left unchanged (0), you will NOT receive severe punishment.

Final rule: Output format (strict JSON, no prose): {"decision":"<0|1>"}
Output only the JSON object, nothing else.

Here is the sentence, proceed to the task:
